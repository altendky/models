[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sunspec/models.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sunspec/models)

The `master_plus_pull_requests` branches in these two repositories are intended to combine several bug fix PRs made against the official SunSpec repositories.  This is being done until the official repositories start handling the PRs and dealing with the issues.  These branches are not intended as forks.  Rather, the merged PRs are ones that are expected would be accepted to the official repository.  Hopfeully I am guessing correctly.

If you find these branches useful and want your own changes included please submit a clean PR against the official `master` branch in the corresponding SunSpec repository and mention @altendky.
